Things to take care of in FlappyBirdGame:

- Make the code efficient, less stress on CPU when repainting.
- Organize the code, remove unnecessary code chunks, white spaces and add comments.
- Add a PAUSE page in the game when user presses 'p'.
- Change where the coins spawn, so they don't spawn on top of the mines, but fairly close to them.
- Add another warning so that users can't enter an empty string as a user name.
